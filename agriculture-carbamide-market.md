<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Carbamide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granular</li><li>Prilled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agriculture carbamide market comprises two primary types: granular and prilled forms. Granular carbamide is produced through a granulation process, resulting in larger, uniform particles that are easy to handle and apply, making it suitable for bulk storage and application. Prilled carbamide, on the other hand, is formed from fine droplets that solidify into smaller, spherical particles, providing rapid dissolution and improved crop absorption. Both forms serve as essential nitrogen fertilizers, enhancing agricultural productivity and soil health.</p></p>
