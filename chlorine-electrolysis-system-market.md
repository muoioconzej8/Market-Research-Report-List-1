<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlorine Electrolysis System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brine System</li><li>Seawater System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chlorine electrolysis systems are primarily categorized into two types: brine systems and seawater systems. Brine systems utilize concentrated saltwater solutions, which are electrolyzed to produce chlorine, caustic soda, and hydrogen. These systems are preferred for their efficiency and high chlorine yield. In contrast, seawater systems employ natural seawater, making them advantageous in coastal areas. They offer a sustainable approach but may have lower efficiency due to impurities. Both systems play vital roles in chlor-alkali production, water treatment, and various industrial applications.</p></p>
